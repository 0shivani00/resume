Madhubani Art (or Mithila painting) is a style of <br>
Indian painting, practiced in the Mithila region of the <br>
Indian subcontinent. This painting is done with a <br>
variety of tools, including fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens,<br> 
and matchsticks and using natural dyes and pigments. It is characterised by its <br>
eye-catching geometrical patterns. There is ritual content for <br>
particular occasions, such as birth or marriage, and festivals, <br>
such as Holi, Surya Shasti, Kali Puja, Upanayana, and Durga Puja.<br><br>

Madhubani painting (Mithila painting) was traditionally created by<br> the women of various communities in the Mithila <br>
region of the Indian subcontinent. It originated from <br>
Madhubani district of the Mithila region of Bihar. Madhubani is <br>
also a major export center of these paintings. This painting as a<br>
form of wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; <br>
the more recent development of painting on paper and canvas mainly <br>
originated among the villages around Madhubani, and it<br>
is these latter developments that led to the term "Madhubani art"<br> being used 
alongside "Mithila Painting.<br><br>
